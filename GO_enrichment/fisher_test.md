# Fisher Test #

**Fisher's exact test** is a statistical significance test used in the analysis of contingency tables. The fisher's exact test could be used in GO and KEGG enrichment analysis.

## Example ##
For example, a sample of teenagers might be divided in to male and female on the one hand, and those that are and are not currently studying for a statistics exam on the other. We hypothesize, for example, that the proportion of studying individuals is higher among the women than ampong the men, and we want to test whether any difference of proportions that we observe is significant. The data might look like this:
|  | **Men** | **Women** | Row total |
| **Studying** | **1** | **9** | 10 |
| **Not-studying** | **11** | **3** | 14 |
| Column total | 12 | 12 | 24 |
For example, we find **300** Differnet expressed genes(DEGs) from **10000** Genes
